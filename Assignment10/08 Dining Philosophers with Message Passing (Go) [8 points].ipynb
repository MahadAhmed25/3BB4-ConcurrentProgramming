    "A deadlock among philosophers is prevented if every philosopher picks up their lower-numbered fork first. The following program has a *runtime monitor* to check that, and the philosophers are *instrumented* with statements communicating their actions to the runtime monitor. The implementation of the philosophers is flawed as every philosopher picks up their left-hand fork (through that fork's right-hand channel) and then their right-hand fork (through that fork's left-hand channel). Hence, the runtime monitor will, at some point, flag that situation and terminate the program."
