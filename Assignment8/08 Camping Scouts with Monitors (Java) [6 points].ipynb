    "A troupe of scouts eats communal dinners from a large pot that can hold `10` servings of chilli. When a scout wants to eat, they help themselves from the pot; if the pot is empty, they wait until the cook has refilled it. If a scout encounters a pot with two or fewer servings left, the scout wakes the cook. The cook rests and, when woken up, first checks if there are indeed two or fewer servings left. If so, the cook fills the pot completely; otherwise, the cook sleeps again. Initially, the pot is empty. The following processes specify the behaviour of the scouts and the cook. Complete `Kitchen`! Give the class invariant as comment! Add print statements in `getServingFromPot` and  `putServingsInPot` to get output that may start with:\n",
