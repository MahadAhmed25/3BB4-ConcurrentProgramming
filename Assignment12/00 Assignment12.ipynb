    "This assignment can be completed in a group of up to 3. Every group member still has to submit, and every submission will be graded independently. The purpose of the groups is to discuss and share solutions. If you are working in a group, you must add the name of one or two other group members in the field below, so identical submissions will not be construed as Academic Dishonesty. The other group members must mention you; it is not sufficient if one group member mentions the other."
