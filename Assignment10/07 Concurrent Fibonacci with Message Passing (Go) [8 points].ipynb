    "> \"A certain man put a pair of rabbits in a place surrounded on all sides by a wall. How many pairs of rabbits can be produced from that pair in a year if it is supposed that every month each pair begets a new pair which from the second month on becomes productive?\" – Leonardo of Pisa, later known as Fibonacci\n",

    "- Process `i`, for `1 < i < N`, receives numbers from `c[i – 1]` and `c[i – 2]`, computes their sum, outputs `i` and the sum on `r`, and the sum on `c[i]`.\n",

In the implementation, this means that only one “downstream process” receives from channels `0` and `N – 2`, no process receives from channel `N - 1`, and two processes receive from each of the other channels. That is, processes `fib(0)` and `fib(N – 2)` should send their computed Fibonacci number only once over their channel, `fib(N – 1)` should not send it at all, and all other processes should send it twice.\n",

The order of insertion in the map of computed numbers does not matter. Comparing two maps with `==` in Go compares only their addresses. The test below uses a function of the `reflect` library for *deep comparison*. [8 points]"
