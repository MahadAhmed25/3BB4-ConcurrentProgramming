    "### Fair Bank Account with Monitors (Java)\n",
    "\n",
    "A bank account is shared by several people (processes). Each person may deposit or withdraw funds from the account. The current balance in the account is the sum of all deposits to date minus the sum of all withdrawals. The balance must never become negative. A process that withdraws an amount that would make the balance negative has to wait until the balance is large enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a monitor in Java to solve the problem. The monitor has two procedures (methods): `deposit(amount)` and `withdraw(amount)`, for positive integer `amount`. If the balance is `0` and processes are requesting to withdraw 300 and 100 and depositing 100, 120, and 180, in that order, an acceptable solution is that the process requesting 100 will be served right after another process deposits 100, even if the request for 300 came before the request for 100. That is, requests should be served as soon as a request can be served. Do not use Java library classes for `Account` (there is no need; the solution is short), though you may use whatever you like for testing. State the monitor invariant!\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation below is *instrumented* with statements that log the execution of `deposit()` and `withdraw()`. This is used for testing that all deposits and withdrawals occur and occur in a valid order. For example, the log could be `D100D180D120W100W300`."
