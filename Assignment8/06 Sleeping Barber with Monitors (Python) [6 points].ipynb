    "Python supports monitors through [Lock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#lock-objects) objects and [Condition](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#condition-objects) objects. A lock is like a binary semaphore, but a lock is bound to the process (thread) that acquired the lock, meaning that only that process can release the lock. The pattern for implementing a monitor in Python is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class M\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.lock = Lock()\n",
    "        self.cond = Condition(self.lock)\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    def m(self):\n",
    "        with self.lock:\n",
    "            ... self.cond.wait() ...\n",
    "    def n(self):\n",
    "        with self.lock:\n",
    "            ... self.cond.signal() ...\n",
    "            ... self.cond.signalAll() ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `with lock: ...` statement is equivalent to calling `lock.acquire()` at the beginning and `lock.release()` in a `finally` clause at the end â€“ that is, the lock is released if an exception is raised or not; it corresponds to the `synchronized(lock) {...}` statement in Java. Like in C/Pthreads, condition objects have to be created with reference to a lock. Multiple conditions can refer to the same lock, as in:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "    self.cond1, self.cond2 = Condition(self.lock), Condition(self.lock)\n",
    "```\n",
